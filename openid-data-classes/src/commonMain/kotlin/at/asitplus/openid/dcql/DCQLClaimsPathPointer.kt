/**
 *  6.4. Claims Path Pointer
 *
 * A claims path pointer is a pointer into the JSON structure of the Verifiable Credential,
 * identifying one or more claims. A claims path pointer MUST be a non-empty array of strings and
 * non-negative integers. A string value indicates that the respective key is to be selected, a
 * null value indicates that all elements of the currently selected array(s) are to be selected;
 * and a non-negative integer indicates that the respective index in an array is to be selected.
 * The path is formed as follows:
 * Start with an empty array and repeat the following until the full path is formed.
 * To address a particular claim within an object, append the key (claim name) to the array.
 * To address an element within an array, append the index to the array (as a non-negative, 0-based
 * integer).To address all elements within an array, append a null value to the array. Verifiers
 * MUST NOT point to the same claim more than once in a single query. Wallets SHOULD ignore such
 * duplicate claim queries.

     * Process the query of the claims path pointer array from left to right:

     * selected element(s). If any of the currently selected element(s) is not an object, abort
     * processing and return an error. If the key does not exist in any element currently selected,
     * remove that element from the selection.
     *
     * If the component is null, select all elements of the currently selected array(s). If any of
     * the currently selected element(s) is not an array, abort processing and return an error.If
     * the component is a non-negative integer, select the element at the respective index in the
     * currently selected array(s). If any of the currently selected element(s) is not an array,
     * abort processing and return an error. If the index does not exist in a selected array,
     * remove that array from the selection.If the set of elements currently selected is empty,
     * abort processing and return an error.The result of the processing is the set of elements
